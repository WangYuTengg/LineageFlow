## About
### <a name="problem-statement"></a>‚ùì Problem Statement
How can we develop a tool that tracks data versions and lineage through the machine learning lifecycle, helping data scientists understand how datasets have changed over time and how different versions of datasets affect model performance?

### <a name="motivation"></a>üí° Motivation
As datasets evolve, tracking their changes and understanding their impact on machine learning models becomes increasingly complex. LineageFlow aims to simplify this process by providing an intuitive tool for data versioning and lineage tracking, ensuring data manageability, quality, and reproducibility.

### <a name="target-audience"></a>üßë Target Audience
- Data Scientists
- Machine Learning Engineers
- Data Engineers
- Organizations needing robust data management solutions

### <a name="value-proposition"></a>‚ùó Value Proposition
LineageFlow leverages Git-like semantics such as branches, commits, merges, and rollbacks to offer a familiar and powerful system for data versioning and lineage tracking. This approach allows users to manage, collaborate, and ensure the quality of their data throughout its lifecycle.

## Roadmap for Scalability and Availability
**Phase 1Ô∏è‚É£: Assessment and Planning**
1. Define Objectives and Metrics
    - Establish performance metrics and scalability goals.
2. Current State Analysis
    - Evaluate existing infrastructure and identify potential bottlenecks.
3. User and Traffic Analysis
    - Understand user behavior, peak usage times, and geographic distribution.
4. Cost Analysis
    - Budget estimation for scalability improvements.

**Phase 2Ô∏è‚É£: Architecture and Design**
1. Microservices Architecture
    - Modularize services for authentication, data management, and versioning.
2. Containerization and Orchestration
    - Use Docker and Kubernetes for efficient resource management.
3. Load Balancing
    - Implement load balancing to distribute traffic and ensure high availability.
4. Database Scaling
    - Use sharding and replication strategies for PostgreSQL.
5. Caching Strategies
    - Implement Redis for caching frequently accessed data.

**Phase 3Ô∏è‚É£: Infrastructure and Deployment**
1. Cloud Adoption
    - Deploy on Google Cloud Platform.
2. Auto-scaling
    - Configure auto-scaling policies to adjust resources based on demand.
3. Data Replication and Backup
    - Implement cross-region data replication and automated backups.

**Phase 4Ô∏è‚É£: Monitoring and Optimization**
1. Real-time Monitoring
    - Use Google Cloud Monitoring for real-time performance tracking.
2. Performance Testing
    - Regular load testing to identify and mitigate performance bottlenecks.
3. Disaster Recovery Plan
    - Develop and test a comprehensive disaster recovery plan.

**Phase 5Ô∏è‚É£: Scaling and Growth**
1. Scalability Testing
    - Conduct tests to ensure the system can handle increased loads.
2. User Feedback
    - Continuously gather and implement user feedback.
3. Global Expansion
    - Expand services to new regions, focusing on scalability and availability.
